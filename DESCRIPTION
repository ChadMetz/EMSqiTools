Description: 
    The EMSqiTools package provides a collection of tools to support quality 
    improvement (QI). It includes functions for importing 
    data from CSV, Excel, and SQL sources; generating  control charts with control limits and annotations;
    summarizing numerator and denominator metrics over time; checking data quality (missingness, duplicates, 
    outliers); and profiling datasets automatically. The package is designed to help 
    healthcare and operations teams monitor performance, identify trends, and 
    improve decision-making.
